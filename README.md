Hello World! I'm Levi Noppers, a 15-year-old software engineer from The Hague, the Netherlands, with a great passion for developing web apps.

Over the past two years, I’ve dedicated myself to learn coding, I mainly focus on the front-end. My journey as a software developer began when I was 12 and wanted to create my first Discord Bot in Python, since then I've improved a lot at coding, day in and day out spent learning and developing webapps in React and Next.js.

I specialize in the front-end and back-end, making sure that every project I work on looks professional and works as intended. My experience includes developing multiple fully-functional websites, creating a database-API with Javascrip for my own social media platform and I'm developing a webstore at the moment.

I’m open to learning and would like to improve my skills, whether it’s by getting better at JavaScript, or looking to problems from a different perspective.

Here, on my GitHub, you can find a showcase of some projects I’ve developed.

I try to implement something new each project I'm working on, so expand my knowledge of programming and expand my skillset as a developer.

I speak both English and Dutch fluently, so communication is an ease.
