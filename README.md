Hello World! I'm Levi Noppers, a 15-year-old software engineer from The Hague, the Netherlands, with a passion for developing web apps.

Over the past two years, I’ve dedicated myself to learn coding, I mainly focus on the front-end. My journey as a software developer began when I was 12 and wanted to create my first Discord Bot, since then I've improved a lot at coding, day in and day out spent on coding new web-apps

I specialize in the front-end and a little back-end, making sure that every project I work on looks professional and works as intended. My experience includes developing multiple fully-functional websites, creating a database-API.

I’m open to learning and would like to improve my skills, whether it’s by exploring a new framework, or finding better solutions to my problems

On my GitHub, you can find a showcase of some of my projects I’ve developed. Each project I've tried to implement something new and different to expand my skillset as a developer.

I speak English and Dutch both fluently so in the future I look forward to meeting fellow developers from all over the planet and settling in a team!
